# The Social Petwork

## Summary
This application is for people who love their pets so much, they want to share them with the world. The user creates a "host" profile, which allows you to make multiple pages for your pets. On these pages, you can post as your pets. Showcase your quirky furbabies while interacting with your other pet-obsessed friends! Leave comments, post photos, make pawsome(or clawsome, if you don't have paws) friends!
